Description:
For this assignment, we will use Pandas in Python to analyze data from some CSV or other source. A suggested assignment is analyzing data extracted from the DVD rental database in a Jupyter Notebook.
We should use:
	-Lambda functions
	-np.where()
	-np.select()
	-For-loops
	-Matplotlib to visualize the data
	-different merge types in Pandas. 
-Extraction methods to get specific data from the    data frame based on specific criteria.
	-transformations to create new variables/columns based on other ones.

Suggested Assignment:

See if you can answer the following questions about the DVD rental database in a Jupyter Notebook:

Create a time-series plot showing daily total revenue for three different countries with three countries in one plot (you will want Matplotlibfor this)
Carry out a sentiment analysis on movie descriptions adding another column to the data frame that provides a sentiment classification. This can be based on a “rules-based system” that you coded OR inference from an LLM such as using the API for chatbot.
Create a visual in the notebook that shows how much revenue is coming from different countries to the DVD store (you will want Matplotlib).
Do an analysis to show which actors are bringing in the most revenue (top 10 ranked)
 Create a new data frame where you classify some different countries into some categories that make sense to you (8 countries min, 20 max) in this df there will be two columns, one column will give the country name, the other column will give the classification category.
Use an appropriate merge to merge that new data frame from the last step with a data frame from the DVD db, that gives the countries, so now countries are connected with their classification. (no need to add this table back to the Postgresql db, just doing it in the notebook is fine)
